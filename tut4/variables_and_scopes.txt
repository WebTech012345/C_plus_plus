variable scope & data types:-


VARIABLES IN C++:-

-> A variable is contsiner to hold data.

-> Variable can be of various types. Primarily we have these variable types in C++ :
1) int 
2) float
3) char
4) double
5) boolen

-> difference between float and double is that if you want to store big numbers after the decemal point then you should use double instead of float.

* for example:-
-> float sum = 34.34; 
-> double sum = 34.34233;


-> char is used to store single character.

-> boolen is used to store true or false.

-> int sum = 34; means sum is an integer variable which holds value 34 in memory






SYNTAX FOR DECLARING VARIABLES IN C++ :-

-> datatype variable_name = value;

* for example {
    int a = 4;
    float b = 34.34;
    char c = 'a';
    boolen d = true;
}

-> Based on scope, variables can be of two types:
1). Local variable
2). Global variable

-> Local variable is declared inside a function and can be used only inside that function.

-> Global variable is declared outside a function and can be used anywhere in the program.


VARIABLE SCOPE:-

-> Scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of the variable is valid.

-> Based on scope we have local and global variables in c++

-> Local Variables : Local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there.

-> Global Variables : Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.

-> can global and local variables have same name in c++ ?  : yes, they can have same name in c++. But it is not a good practice to do so.

C++ DATATYPES :-

-> Data types define the type of data a variable can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.

-> Data type in C++ are categorized in three groups :
1). Built-in
2). User-defined
3). Derived

-> Built-in data types are the data types that are predefined in C++, such as int, float, double, char, bool etc.

-> User-defined data types are the data types that are defined by the user, such as struct, union, enum etc.



-> Derived data types are the data types that are derived from built-in data types, such as array, pointer, function etc.



#  use \n for new line in the code


# char c = 'ab'; (don't use more than one character in char variable)


# a variable which is created in function are called as local variable and a variable which is created outside the function are called as global variable.


# local variable takes first priority over global variable.

for example :- 

int a = 10; // global variable
int main() {
    int a = 20; // local variable
    cout << a << endl; // this will print the value of local variable
    return 0;
}


# in this boolen variable we can use only true or false if it is true then it will print 1 and if it is false then it will print 0



RULES TO DECLARE VARIABLES IN C++ :-

-> Variable names in C++ can range from 1 to 255 characters.

-> All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore ( _ ).

-> After the first inital letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers.

-> Variable names are case sensitive.

-> No spaces or special characters are allowed in variable names.

-> You cannot use a C++ Keyword (a reserved Keyword) as a variable name.

Keyword in C++ are :-

-> auto
-> break
-> case
-> char
-> const
-> continue
-> default
-> do
-> double
-> else
-> enum
-> extern
-> float
-> for
-> goto
-> if
-> int
-> long
-> register
-> return
-> short
-> signed
-> sizeof
-> static
-> struct
-> switch
-> typedef
-> union
-> unsigned
-> void
-> volatile
-> while
